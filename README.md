# Important Points:
- How to use user defaults in SwiftUI with the help of a property wrapper @AppStorage
   @AppStorage -> a special SwiftUI property wrapper that uses user defaults behind the scenes. It can store value in device’s permanent storage by utilizing a get and set method
- How to add drag gesture and update the UI accordingly
- Adding animations into the UI for better transitions
- Add horizontal parallax effect with the help of drag gesture
- Use absolute values for parallax effect
- Use rotation effect with drag gesture
- Use sounds for screen transitions
- Use haptic feedback for full and half drag gesture
